It is meant for both server side as well as the user side. The Dart SDK comes with its compiler – the Dart VM and a utility dart2js which is meant for generating Javascript equivalent of a Dart Script so that it can be run on those sites also which don’t support Dart. \n\nDart is Object-oriented language and is quite similar to that of Java Programming. Dart is extensively use to create single-page websites and web-applications. Best example of dart application is Gmail.\n\nYou can install Dart SDK from their official website or download the installer from this site.\n\nInstallation\n\nFor Windows OS: \n\nTo install dart in window system we will be using Chocolatey."
