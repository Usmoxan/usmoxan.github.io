It is meant for both server side as well as the user side. The Dart SDK comes with its compiler – the Dart VM and a utility dart2js which is meant for generating Javascript equivalent of a Dart Script so that it can be run on those sites also which don’t support Dart. \n\nDart is Object-oriented language and is quite similar to that of Java Programming. Dart is extensively use to create single-page websites and web-applications. Best example of dart application is Gmail.\n\nYou can install Dart SDK from their official _{https://dart.dev/tools/sdk/archive, color:green}website_ or download the installer from this _{https://gekorm.com/dart-windows/, color:green}site_.\n\n*~{fontSize:32}Installation~*\n\n\n*For Windows OS:*\n\nTo install dart in window system we will be using Chocolatey.\n\nTo install Dart:\n\n~{backgroundColor:grey}C:\\> choco install dart-sdk~\nTo Update Dart:\n\n~{backgroundColor:grey}C:\\> choco upgrade dart-sdk~\n\n*Modify PATH for access to all Dart binaries*\n\nAfter installing the SDK, add its bin directory to your PATH. For example, use the following command to change PATH in your active terminal session:\n\n~{backgroundColor:grey}$ export PATH=\"$PATH:/usr/lib/dart/bin\"~\nTo change the PATH for future terminal sessions, use a command like this:\n\n~{backgroundColor:grey}$ echo 'export PATH=\"$PATH:/usr/lib/dart/bin\"' >> ~/.profile~\n\n*First Code in Dart:*\nIn dart main() function is predefined method and acts as the entry point to the application. A dart script needs the main() method for execution of the code. The program code goes like this:",
